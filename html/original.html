      <span class="bold-words">How It All Started:</span> Perhaps one of the biggest questions of my childhood was whoâ€™s 
      the better cook, Mom or Dad? I've come to the conclusion that they
      both have their moments of greatness... and sometimes not so much. 
      In my 18 years of being alive, one thing that I've always cherished  is our family dinners.

      <span class="bold-words">The How:</span> Whether it was Moms iconic butter 
      chicken or classic haystacks, food has
      always broght us together. As Sydney and 
      I grew older our schedules got busier but we'd always make an effort to have a 
      family dinner.  (Usually followed with a game of euchre) And over the years we've stumbled upon some 
      pretty good recipes

    <p class="second-paragraph container-left">   
      <span class="bold-words">The Purpose:</span> If we want to keep all these amazing dishes rotating in our family for 
      years to come it was time to modernize our method for storing recipes. 
      Hopefully this website helps everyone to always access all of our delicious 
      recipes!! Everything except hokna.
